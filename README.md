default/deathstar-5b559d699b-d4jm7: Back-off pulling image "docker.io/cilium/starwaraaes"


The Kubernetes error message: Back-off pulling image "docker.io/cilium/starwaraaes" means that the Kubernetes cluster is having trouble pulling the specified container image from the Docker registry. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check if the specified image exists in the Docker registry by running the following command:

    `docker pull docker.io/cilium/starwaraaes`

2. If the image exists, try pulling the image manually on the node where the container is trying to run. This can be done by running the following command:

    `docker pull docker.io/cilium/starwaraaes`

3. If the image is not found in the Docker registry, check if the image name and tag are correct.

4. If the issue persists, check the Docker engine logs for any error messages that might provide more context on the issue.
